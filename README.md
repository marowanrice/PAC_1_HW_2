# PAC_1_HW_2
Time Difference assignment for PAC 1

GRADE: 10/10

Assignment:
Write a program that accepts user input of two time values and computes the difference between
them. The times are read into the program as integers of at most 6 digits (without leading zeros):
HHMMSS, where HH represents hours according to a 24-hour clock (0-23), MM represents
minutes (0-59) and SS represents seconds (0-59). The difference should be displayed in the
same format.

The difference can be either positive or negative. It is obtained by subtracting the second time
from the first time - make sure that you do not subtract the first time from the second, as this will
produce incorrect answers.

For the purposes of this assignment, you may assume that the inputs are correct--that is, the
input values will be valid positive integers no more than 6 digits in length and the hours, minutes
and seconds will be within the proper ranges (e.g., seconds will be within 0-59).

Please note that you are not being asked to convert an AM/PM 12-hour format to a 24- hour
format.
